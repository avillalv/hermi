# Phase 1 progress

The build's memory. Every autopilot session updates this file in its pull request, and the next session resumes from here (see [AUTOPILOT.md](AUTOPILOT.md)). The driver runs the units in order: S1 to S3, then prompts 01 to 28, then the final check.

## Current prompt

03, staging and production environments (branch `phase1/p03-deploy-environments`). One ticket, WF-009 (size L), split in two steps (one session each):

1. WF-009.1 Render blueprint and Cloudflare rules: `infra/render/render.yaml` (API web service, worker, Postgres 18 with PITR, for staging and production; env groups `hermi-staging` and `hermi-prod`, secrets declared `sync: false` only; `AI_PROVIDER=anthropic_api` pinned; pre-deploy command `hermi migrate && hermi seed` with `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`; health check `/health/ready`; staging smaller sizes). `infra/cloudflare/rules.md` completed: TLS Full (strict), authenticated origin pulls (drop the "proxied off" note on `api`), WAF and rate rules as reviewed text, Pages build for `apps/web`, `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`. Test: a node test (`scripts/`) that parses `render.yaml` and asserts the pins (Postgres 18, PITR, `AI_PROVIDER=anthropic_api`, pre-deploy command, no literal secret values, separate staging and production `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` entries).
2. WF-009.2 Deploy workflows, smoke and rollback: `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml` (on push to `main`: build and push the image to GHCR tagged with the SHA, trigger the Render staging deploy, wait for `/health/ready`, run the post-deploy smoke, 10 minute timeout) and `deploy-prod.yml` (manual `workflow_dispatch` or tag `vYYYY.MM.DD.N`, `environment: production` with required reviewers, promote the same image digest with no rebuild, smoke, rollback to the previous deploy when `/health/ready` fails for 2 minutes). Both gate on `vars.DEPLOY_ENABLED == 'true'` and skip with a clear message when secrets are absent. `scripts/deploy-smoke.mjs` (post-deploy smoke) and the rollback decision as a testable script; a test with a forced failing health check (local stub server) proves rollback is triggered, recorded in the PR. Replace the placeholder `deploy` job in `ci.yml` so `ci` stays green. `docs/deploy.md` lists every GitHub secret and variable and every env group key.

Tests: `npm run lint`, `npm test` (the split suites) each step; no user flow changes, so no e2e smoke; the dash grep before docs commits.

Risks: `hermi migrate` and `hermi seed` are placeholders until WF-011 (prompt 04), so the pre-deploy command points at commands that land later; `/health/ready` reports migrations `none` until then. Render has no OIDC, so deploys need a Render API key in GitHub secrets despite 02 section 10 ("OIDC, never stored cloud keys"); GHCR pushes use the workflow `GITHUB_TOKEN` (OIDC-style, no stored key). Record both in `DECISIONS.md`. Spec gives no Render plan tiers or region; pick the smallest that fits and record it. Preview environments (02 section 9) are not in WF-009 and are skipped. No new dependency: YAML is parsed with what is installed (check before adding). Dependencies: WF-008 is merged (#8).

Owner-pending items (WF-009): the Render and Cloudflare accounts, GitHub secrets, env groups and `DEPLOY_ENABLED`; a merge to `main` reaches staging with migrations applied in under 10 minutes; production deploy needs approval; secrets live only in platform env groups; separate Anthropic workspace keys for staging and production. These go to `HUMAN_TASKS.md` (the existing Render and Cloudflare row) in the ticket and ship sessions.

## Notes for later prompts

Things a later prompt must know (a helper that exists, a pattern to reuse, a known limitation).

- S3 ship review follow-ups: (1) prompt 14 line 38 gives the live evals command in Bash form; the owner uses PowerShell, so point at `HUMAN_TASKS.md` row 21 instead. (2) Prompt 10 Owner-only steps name `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` and `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY`, `HUMAN_TASKS.md` row 13 lists other variables; make them equal. (3) Prompts 18, 22, 24, 25 and 27 have an "Owner verification pending" note (WF-121, WF-088 and 089, WF-100 to 102, WF-127 and 128, WF-112) that their Owner-only steps section does not list; add a bullet each.
- S2.1.1 follow-up for S2.2: the kit still calls the section strip a `tablist` (`design/DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md` near lines 179 and 236, `design/components.html` near 919 and 932, `h-strip` in `design/screens/` 03, 04, 06, 07, 08); 05 now says `nav` with `aria-current="page"`. Align the kit markup and wording.
- S1.5 follow-ups: 03 needs a place for the hashed legacy claim token (`POST /me/legacy-claim`, WF-040): a small table or columns on the pre-created legacy `users` row; 04 section 5.1 carries a note to remove once 03 has it. 03 `clear_my_ai_history` (line near 2906) only nulls run content, while 04 `DELETE /me/ai-history` deletes `runs`, `run_events` and AI notes; align 03. 01, 02 and 10 must mirror the 04 5.26 imports limits table. 03 gives `link_clicks.redirect_status` no value set; 04 defines it as the HTTP status sent (add a DECISIONS row if kept).
- S1.4 follow-ups: `bootstrap_user()` (03 section 6) needs a sixth parameter `p_provider_subject text` that writes `auth_identities.provider_subject`, with the ALTER, REVOKE and GRANT lines in 6.1 and 6.1.1 updated, and 04 `/me/bootstrap` passes it (S1.5 or an S1.3 round before the S1 merge). 04 must use `device_attestations`, `guest_allowances`, `spend_guest_allowance` and the guest endpoints. 08 line 278 must say `serpapi_live_fares` is off (S1.7). 07 section 5.4 needs a one-line match for the taster-first rule for `agent_run`. The `credit_grants_select` policy (6.4) must let trip members see `trip_pass` grants.
